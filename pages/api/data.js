      Yog ("Yoga" in hindi) - this word in itself is like a complete science which unites body, mind, soul and universe. The history of yoga is about 5000 years old, known in ancient Indian philosophy as the practice of mind and body. Different styles of yoga combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxation.

Aurobindo (1999) defines yoga as ‚Äúa practical discipline incorporating a wide variety of practices whose goal is the development of a state of mental and physical health, well-being, inner harmony and ultimately a union of the human individual with the universal and transcendent existence‚Äù.

In today‚Äôs time, most of the employees spend a large portion of their time in their offices. Health problems-- stressed or distress, obesity, low backache, respiratory disorders, 
cardiovascular problems, digestive disorders and genitourinary disorders are prevalent at 
corporate world and cause a huge decline in the corporate health and wealth. An unhealthy, unhappy employee will lead to inefficiencies, which directly affect the organisation's outputs.

All these health issues can be addressed with regular yoga practice and thus can lead to overall health promotion, disease prevention and rehabilitation. Particularly, yoga has been found effective to manage work related stress, respiratory disorders (asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, pleural effusion, obstructive pulmonary diseases, chronic bronchitis), cardiovascular disorders (ischemic heart disease, coronary artery disease, angina, chronic heart attack.

      <br>
      <br>

      While sitting in the chair, turn to your left side. Hold the back of the chair with your left hand. Stay in this pose while breathing for 30-40 seconds. Then repeat it on the other side as well. <u>This asana is good for diabetes and reducing abdominal fat.</u>

      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Step 1: The Position</strong> - To perform the Kapalbhati, if possible, sit in Vajrasana or Sukhasana, if not then you can do it while sitting on the chair also. Remember to keep your spine straight, your shoulders relaxed, and your neck unstrained.
      
      <strong>Step 2: Breathing Routine</strong>- Now press gently on the right nostril from your right thumb while you exhale through the left with force. Repeat on the other side. This step is to clear the nostrils. Now that both the nostrils are open, take a deep breath and start exhaling with force while squeezing the stomach in. Breathe in softly, and breathe out completely and with force.
      
      Last but not the least, rather very important, focus on your nose tips and your breathing and meditate for a few minutes to get the best results of Yoga.
      
      <strong>Quoting the first sutra of Patanjali:</strong> ‚ÄúAtha Yoganushasanam: if there is an intention to practice Yoga, Yoga has already begun. Having the intention to care about physical and emotional human health is the first step and it is important to know how it can be cultivated through the mindful practice of Yoga, holistically healing the mind and body.

      There can be a wide range of reasons that can affect mental health of an individual and these reasons affect mood, thinking, and overall behavior. Some common reasons include anxiety, depression, addiction, eating disorders (anorexia and bulimia), and schizophrenia. What makes these situations even more difficult is that most families are not prepared to cope with learning that their loved ones have a mental illness.

Millions of people suffer from different types and severities of mental health disorders each day. In fact, as we learn more about different types of mental health disorders, we are beginning to realize how common it is to suffer from mental illness, and how treatable mental illness is if properly identified and addressed.

There are times when someone might function relatively well, but then they experience a loss ‚Äî of a job, a loved one, of finances or of structure ‚Äî and then they start to crumble. If you have the emotional bandwidth, there are certain small signs and signals you can look for in your friends and family to figure out if they need help, support, or just someone to talk to.

      `,
      desc2: `
      <strong>Keep these 5 signs of mental illness in mind and see if you or someone in your life might need to seek help:</strong>

      <br> <br>
      <strong>1. Withdrawal From Social Activities:</strong>
      <br> <br>
<u>Behavioral Signs : Have there been changes in your friend's/relative‚Äôs typical routines or behaviors?</u>

Mental illness can negatively impact socialization in many ways. For instance, depression can make every action seem exhausting and deprive someone of the energy they need to take part in social interactions.

<strong>2. Energy Levels:</strong>
<br> <br>
<u>Physical signs : Changes in sleep, energy levels or appetite may indicate a problem. Is your friend‚Äôs speech slower than normal?</u>

With severe clinical depression your energy levels get so low that you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning or carrying through your basic activities of daily living.

<strong>3. When They Start Joking About Suicide: </strong>
<br> <br>
<u>Cognitive signs: What thoughts are going through their minds? Are they nihilistic, negative, critical or judgmental?</u>

Suicidal ideation with no intent to act on is a common coping mechanism for many. However, coping mechanisms only come into play when you need to cope with something. If someone you know starts making jokes about suicide too frequently, make sure you ask them and help them out if needed. 

<strong>4. Feeling depressed or unhappy:</strong>
<br> <br>
<u>Emotional signs: Fear, anxiety, depression and anger are emotional warning signs</u>

Signs of depression include being sad or irritable for continued periods, lacking in motivation and energy, losing interest in a hobby or being teary all the time.

<strong>5. Sleep problems:</strong>
<br> <br>
<u>Spiritual signs: Does someone you know is feeling helpless, hopeless or guilty?</u>

Lasting changes to a person‚Äôs sleep patterns could be a symptom of a mental health disorder. For example, insomnia could be a sign of anxiety or substance abuse. Sleeping too much or too little could indicate depression or a sleeping disorder.

Mental health in general refers to the general state of how you regulate your behavior, feelings, and thoughts. There‚Äôs no standard for measuring what‚Äôs normal for you versus what could be a reason for concern in someone else, but poor mental health could negatively affect:

- How well you get along with family and friends
- Your productivity at work or school
- Your interest in activities, social settings, and other situations
- Energy levels.

Being physically and emotionally healthy helps you to help others.It is important to remember that there is hope for recovery and that with Yoga, Meditation, Pranayam and a dedicated Yoga Teacher or Yog Therapist,  many people with mental illness can return to a productive and fulfilling life.

      There is a saying that says, <strong>"Your health is in your hands"</strong>. 

      The hands of Lord Buddha sitting in meditation are always in a particular position. This position of the hands is called mudra / hasta mudra in yoga science. In English they are called Mudras or Hand Gestures.Yoga helps you stay healthy and fight serious diseases with the power of mudras. Some yoga experts also call mudras as 'Hasta Yoga'. And there's a good chance it's inspired by yoga. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Gheranda Samhita are the main texts on mudras. Hatha Yoga Pradipika describes 10 mudras and Gherand Samhita describes 25 mudras. Some yoga postures are comfortable for us. The mudras correspond to the Ayurvedic understanding of the human body and its doshas (humors), namely Vata, Pitta and Kapha.Mudras can affect the physical, emotional and spiritual energy of your body. The practice of the mudra with the yogic breath stimulates the various organs of the body and awakens the flow of prana in the body. According to Ayurveda, diseases are caused by imbalance in the body, and this imbalance is due to deficiency or excess of five elements. Our fingers have the qualities of these elements. Just by touching the hands with our fingers we can influence our attitude, thinking. And there you can heal the body with your inner strength. Our body is made up of these five elements: earth, water, fire, air and sky. To keep the body healthy, it is necessary to keep these elements under control. 
      
      Mudras influence the balance of the five elements ‚Äì earth, water, air, fire and ether ‚Äì in the body by controlling the flow of energy and facilitating health benefits. The specialty of the five elements is contained in the fingers of our hands. In the five fingers of the hand, air is located on the index finger, water on the little finger, fire on the thumb, earth on the ring finger and sky (space) on the middle finger. The thumb corresponds to the fire element or Agni. It symbolizes emotions like anxiety and is related to the stomach. The index finger corresponds to air or wind, and is related to feelings such as sadness, loss, or grief. It connects to the large intestine and lungs in the body. The middle finger is associated with the sky or the sky, and corresponds to the heart and the cardiovascular system of the body. It governs emotions like carelessness or spontaneity.The ring finger represents Prithvi or Earth, and controls anger. It is associated with the gallbladder, liver and nervous system. The last or little finger corresponds to water or the water element, and controls fear when connected to the kidneys. These five elements can be kept under control by the fingers and thumb of the hand.

      desc2: `
      
Usually, many elements present in our body are not in a balanced state due to which various diseases occur in the body and the person starts suffering from mild to serious problems. In such a condition, yoga mudra works to balance the five elements of the body and also helps in keeping the whole body healthy. Gyan Mudra is considered to be one of the most important mudras. As we know, it is believed to be the mudra that Buddha used most often and which accompanied the revelation of the Gita to Arjuna by Lord Krishna. It is a sacred hand gesture used by yogis to 'tap' and by dancers depicting Nataraja Mudra. There are many different types of mudras classified according to the part of the body they engage. Hasta mudra refers to hand gestures, while mana mudra refers to head gestures. Bandha mudra involves lock gestures, and kaya mudra refers to postural gestures. Adhara mudra includes perineal gestures. 10 Hand Mudras: There are ten important mudras in hand mudras which are as follows:- 1.Gyan Mudra, 2.Prithvi Mudra, 3.Varun Mudra, 4.Vayu Mudra, 5.Zero Mudra, 6.Surya Mudra , 7.
